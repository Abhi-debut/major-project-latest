            <h1>What Is Cancer?</h1>
            <p>The Definition of Cancer
Cancer is a disease in which some of the body’s cells grow uncontrollably and spread to other parts of the body. 

Cancer can start almost anywhere in the human body, which is made up of trillions of cells. Normally, human cells grow and multiply (through a process called cell division) to form new cells as the body needs them. When cells grow old or become damaged, they die, and new cells take their place.

Sometimes this orderly process breaks down, and abnormal or damaged cells grow and multiply when they shouldn’t. These cells may form tumors, which are lumps of tissue. Tumors can be cancerous or not cancerous (benign). 

Cancerous tumors spread into, or invade, nearby tissues and can travel to distant places in the body to form new tumors (a process called metastasis). Cancerous tumors may also be called malignant tumors. Many cancers form solid tumors, but cancers of the blood, such as leukemias, generally do not.

Benign tumors do not spread into, or invade, nearby tissues. When removed, benign tumors usually don’t grow back, whereas cancerous tumors sometimes do. Benign tumors can sometimes be quite large, however. Some can cause serious symptoms or be life threatening, such as benign tumors in the brain.</p>

         Differences between Cancer Cells and Normal Cells
Cancer cells differ from normal cells in many ways. For instance, cancer cells:
<ul>
  <li>grow in the absence of signals telling them to grow. Normal cells only grow when they receive such signals. 
</li>
  <li>ignore signals that normally tell cells to stop dividing or to die (a process known as programmed cell death, or apoptosis).</li>
  <li>invade into nearby areas and spread to other areas of the body. Normal cells stop growing when they encounter other cells, and most normal cells do not move around the body. </li>
  <li>tell blood vessels to grow toward tumors.  These blood vessels supply tumors with oxygen and nutrients and remove waste products from tumors.</li>
  <li>hide from the immune system. The immune system normally eliminates damaged or abnormal cells. </li>
  <li>trick the immune system into helping cancer cells stay alive and grow. For instance, some cancer cells convince immune cells to protect the tumor instead of attacking it.</li>
  <li>accumulate multiple changes in their chromosomes, such as duplications and deletions of chromosome parts. Some cancer cells have double the normal number of chromosomes.</li>
  <li>rely on different kinds of nutrients than normal cells. In addition, some cancer cells make energy from nutrients in a different way than most normal cells. This lets cancer cells grow more quickly. </li>
</ul>

            <h1>How Does Cancer Develop?</h1>
            <div class="wrapper" ><img src="https://www.cancer.gov/sites/g/files/xnrzdm211/files/styles/cgov_article/public/cgov_contextual_image/900/300/files/DNA-structure-enlarge.jpg?h=1cb9984c&itok=5X1x6Ow5"  width="500px" height="400px" alt="" ></img>    
    
            <p>Cancer is a genetic disease—that is, it is caused by changes to genes that control the way our cells function, especially how they grow and divide.
            Genetic changes that cause cancer can happen because:

<ul>
  <li>of errors that occur as cells divide. </li>
  <li>of damage to DNA caused by harmful substances in the environment, such as the chemicals in tobacco smoke and ultraviolet rays from the sun. (Our Cancer Causes and Prevention section has more information). </li>
  <li>they were inherited from our parents </li>
  
</ul>  
The body normally eliminates cells with damaged DNA before they turn cancerous. But the body’s ability to do so goes down as we age. This is part of the reason why there is a higher risk of cancer later in life.

Each person’s cancer has a unique combination of genetic changes. As the cancer continues to grow, additional changes will occur. Even within the same tumor, different cells may have different genetic changes.</p>

  <h1>When Cancer Spreads?</h1>     
  <div class="wrapper"><img src="https://www.cancer.gov/sites/g/files/xnrzdm211/files/styles/cgov_article/public/cgov_contextual_image/900/300/files/metastasis-enlarge.jpg?itok=CBtbX_qG"  width="400px" height="400px" alt=""></img>
  
        

<p class="mop">
          
          A cancer that has spread from the place where it first formed to another place in the body is called metastatic cancer. The process by which cancer cells spread to other parts of the body is called metastasis.<br />
          Metastatic cancer has the same name and the same type of cancer cells as the original, or primary, cancer. For example, breast cancer that forms a metastatic tumor in the lung is metastatic breast cancer, not lung cancer.<br />
          
          Under a microscope, metastatic cancer cells generally look the same as cells of the original cancer. Moreover, metastatic cancer cells and cells of the original cancer usually have some molecular features in common, such as the presence of specific chromosome changes.<br />
          In some cases, treatment may help prolong the lives of people with metastatic cancer. In other cases, the primary goal of treatment for metastatic cancer is to control the growth of the cancer or to relieve symptoms it is causing. Metastatic tumors can cause severe damage to
           how the body functions, and most people who die of cancer die of metastatic disease.  </p></div>
  
  
  
  <h2>Symptoms of Cancer</h2>
 
        <p>
            <ol>
  <li>Fatigue: Imagine feeling really tired, even though you've had enough rest or sleep. It's like your body just can't seem to get enough energy.
</li>
  <li>Weakness: This is when you feel like you have no strength in your body, almost like you've been running around all day and you're completely worn out.</li>
  <li>Frequent Infections: It's like catching a cold or getting sick often, but more than usual. Your body's defense system, which fights off germs, isn't working as well as it should.</li>
  <li>Unexplained Weight Loss: Losing weight without trying or without changes in diet or exercise.
</li>
  <li>Fever or Night Sweats: Experiencing unexplained fevers or night sweats, which may be severe.

</li>
  <li>Swollen Lymph Nodes: Lymph nodes (small, bean-shaped structures) may swell in the neck, armpits, or groin.
</li>
  <li>Bone Pain: Pain in the bones, typically in the back or ribs.
</li>
  <li>Shortness of Breath: Difficulty breathing, even during routine activities.</li>
  <li>Enlarged Spleen or Liver: The spleen or liver may become enlarged, causing discomfort or a feeling of fullness in the abdomen.</li>
  <li>Purplish Patches or Spots: Small, purplish patches or spots under the skin, known as petechiae, may appear due to bleeding.</li>
  <li>Headaches: Persistent or severe headaches, which may be accompanied by other symptoms like vision changes or confusion.</li>
  <li>Pale Skin: Skin may appear unusually pale due to anemia caused by low red blood cell count.</li>
  <li>Abdominal Pain: Pain or discomfort in the abdomen, often associated with an enlarged spleen or liver.</li>
  <li>Confusion or Changes in Mental Status: Cognitive changes such as confusion or difficulty concentrating, which may indicate central nervous system involvement.</li>
</ol>

            <h2>Treatment for Luekemia :</h2>
            <p>
            <ol>
  <li><b>Chemotherapy:</b> Chemotherapy works by targeting rapidly dividing cells, which includes cancer cells. It's often used as the first-line treatment for leukemia because it can reach cancer cells throughout the body. However, it can also affect healthy cells that divide quickly, such as those in the bone marrow, hair follicles, and digestive tract, leading to side effects like hair loss, nausea, and increased risk of infections.
</li>
  <li><b>Targeted Therapy:</b> Unlike chemotherapy, which affects both cancerous and healthy cells, targeted therapy specifically targets certain molecules or pathways that are crucial for cancer cell growth and survival. By focusing on these specific targets, targeted therapy can often be more precise and cause fewer side effects than chemotherapy. However, not all leukemias have targeted therapies available, and resistance can develop over time.</li>
  <li><b>Immunotherapy:</b> Immunotherapy harnesses the power of the body's immune system to fight cancer. This can include monoclonal antibodies, which target specific proteins on cancer cells, or checkpoint inhibitors, which release the brakes on the immune system, allowing it to recognize and attack cancer cells. Immunotherapy is a rapidly evolving field, and while it has shown promise in some types of leukemia, it's not yet widely used as a standard treatment for all cases.</li>
  <li><b>Stem Cell Transplant:</b> Stem cell transplant, also known as a bone marrow transplant, is a procedure in which diseased or damaged bone marrow is replaced with healthy stem cells from a donor. This can be an effective treatment for leukemia, particularly in cases where chemotherapy or other treatments have not been successful. However, it's a complex procedure with risks of complications, including graft-versus-host disease, where the donor cells attack the recipient's tissues.
</li>
  <li><b>Radiation Therapy:</b> Radiation therapy uses high-energy rays or particles to kill cancer cells or stop them from growing. It's often used in leukemia treatment to target specific areas of the body where cancer cells have spread, such as the brain or bones. Radiation therapy is usually delivered externally through a machine, but it can also be given internally in some cases.

</li>
  <li><b>Clinical Trials:</b> Clinical trials are research studies that evaluate new treatments or treatment combinations for leukemia. Participating in a clinical trial can give patients access to innovative therapies that may not be available otherwise. However, it's important to understand the potential risks and benefits of participating in a clinical trial and to discuss these with your healthcare team.
</li>
  <li><b>Supportive Care:</b> Supportive care plays a crucial role in leukemia treatment by managing symptoms and side effects, as well as providing emotional and psychological support. This can include medications to alleviate pain or nausea, blood transfusions to address anemia, and nutritional support to maintain strength and energy levels.

</li>
</ol> 
Overall, the choice of treatment for leukemia depends on various factors, including the type and stage of leukemia, the patient's overall health and preferences, and the expertise of the healthcare team. It's essential for patients to work closely with their healthcare providers to develop a personalized treatment plan that addresses their individual needs and goals.
